  <section>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a multidisciplinary background in
        Renewable Energy Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Computer
        Science. My work focuses on developing data-driven models and intelligent
        systems for engineering and energy-related applications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have hands-on experience applying machine learning techniques,
        including artificial neural networks, to tasks such as system
        performance prediction, thermal behavior modeling, and engineering
        optimization. I am particularly interested in bridging first-principles
        engineering analysis with modern AI and computational methods.
